<h2 class="center-text">How it works ?</h2>
<p>The program operates on two fundamental schemas:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Project-by-Project Funding</strong>: Each student or team can pitch their project idea to potential sponsors, investors, and funding bodies. This model allows for targeted funding, ensuring that each project has the resources it needs to succeed.</li>
    <li><strong>Resources for Funding</strong>: We've developed a comprehensive mind map outlining potential funding sources, including grants, scholarships, sponsorships, and partnerships. This resource aims to guide students in securing the necessary funds for their projects.</li>
</ol>
