            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>The current landscape of higher education often leaves students having to choose between pursuing their studies and working to support themselves. This dilemma can hinder their ability to gain practical skills and experience necessary for todayâ€™s dynamic work environment. Moreover, the lack of funding for entrepreneurial initiatives within academic settings has become a significant barrier to innovation and development. The Student-Entrepreneur Internship Program is our answer to these challenges.</p>
